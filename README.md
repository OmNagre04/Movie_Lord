# Movie-Lord
Description:

-These entire website is entirely built on the react & tailwind.<br>
-I used Appwrite for handling a little bit of backend which is helpful to show the personalized trending section of the personlized most search movies by writing an simple algo. by which it counts the number of time the user visited or clicked or search a particular movie.<br>
-For styling purpose I used the latest version of the Tailwind CSS

The source code of the website is available in this repo.

I optimized the search by using debouncing so the api or the server will not get overwhelmed.
